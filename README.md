# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- I was curious about the upcoming bootcamp and haven't practiced much coding so I wanted to learn more.  
- I built the Prework Study Guide as a way to help me discover and learn more about coding.  
- This taught me the backbones of different languages,
- During this time, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. AND building the study guide really helped me learn about Git and how to use my terminal to connect whats on my local branch to GitHub.

## Usage
The Prework Study Guide contains notes about different coding languages and can be used by Developers and Students (aspiring developers!) alike. To use this Study Guide open index.html up on a website.  Once there, the user can see HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.  There are sections for each and helpful tips and tricks written about each topic to help with learning.  For suggestions on what to study first, open up the DevTools console (on Mac Option+Command+I).  There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
